    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A nutritious egg dish. The mayonnaise rises like the sun over the rippling poached egg's surface, and the exquisite mouthfeel really hits the spot. The unique salty flavor of the ham cuts right through the mix as well, like light parting the gathered clouds.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bird Egg</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Ham</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan on medium-low heat until fully melted and hot</li>
        <li>Separate 4 egg yolks (save egg whites for own use, don't be wasteful)</li>
        <li>In a blender, add egg yolks, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper in. Blend on medium for 30 seconds to incorporate air and heat to the eggs</li>
        <li>After 30 seconds, slowly pour melted butter while blender is on low.</li>
        <li>Check for consistency and adjust accordingly. Add more butter if too thick, add another egg yolk if too thin</li>
        <li>Pour sauce into saucepan and keep on low or warm until ready</li>
        <li>Pan fry ham on medium high for 1 minute per side to add some color and render out fat</li>
        <li>Use fat from ham to toast bread for 2-3 minutes per side</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil then lower heat to keep water at a simmer</li>
        <li>Crack an egg into a bowl</li>
        <li>Swirl water with a spoon to create a vortex and gently pour egg into the water</li>
        <li>Let this cook for 1.5 - 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Repeat for the 2nd egg</li>
        <li>Assemble by placing toast, then ham, then egg, then sauce, then sprinkle paprika and parsley on top</li>
    </ol>
